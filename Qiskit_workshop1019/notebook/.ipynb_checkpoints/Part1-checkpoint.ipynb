    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> In the final part of this notebook about qubits and gates, we are going to present a couple of paradigmatic quantum algorithms and see how they can be implemented in practice in qiskit. You can find many more examples by digging into the quantum computing literature: the book by Nielsen and Chuang, _Quantum Computation and Quantum Information_ is of course a good place to start, and you may want to have a look to this website as well: http://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/  (mirrored also at <http://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/>). Many interesting examples already implemented in qiskit are also available in the official qiskit tutorials. For didactic purposes, we present here only a very simple oracle-based algorithm (Deutsch's algorithm on $N=2$ qubits) and a slightly more advanced one (Quantum Fourier Transform on $N=3$ qubits). In [Part 2](./Part2.ipynb) we will explore more application-oriented algorithms for Digital Quantum Simulations.</p>"

Usually, the second register is initialized in the blank state $\\left|y\\right\\rangle=\\left|0\\right\\rangle^{\\otimes m}$.

The answer, as shown below with Deutsch's algorithm, is that it can provide significant advantages whenever we are not interested in particular output values of $f$, but rather in studying the global properties of the function itself.\n",
