It is arguably the most dramatic example of how the paradigm of quantum computing changed our perception of which computational problems should be considered tractable, motivating the study of new quantum algorithms and efforts to design and construct quantum computers. It also has expedited research into new cryptosystems not based on integer factorization. \n",

    "Note that two numbers are coprime, if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1. This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor being 1. For example, 8 and 15 are coprime, as they don't share any common factors (other than 1). However, 9 and 15 are not coprime, since they are both divisible by 3 (and 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "> Since $\\mathcal{F}(a)$ is a periodic function, it has some period $r$. Knowing that $x^0 \\bmod N = 1$, this means that $x^r \\bmod N = 1$ since the function is periodic, and thus $r$ is just the first nonzero power where $x^r = 1 (\\bmod N)$.\n",

    "$$ (x^{r/2} + 1)(x^{r/2} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod N $$\n",

Thus, so long as $(x^{r/2} + 1)$ or $(x^{r/2} - 1)$ is not a multiple of $N$, then at least one of $(x^{r/2} + 1)$ or $(x^{r/2} - 1)$ must have a nontrivial factor in common with $N$. \n",
